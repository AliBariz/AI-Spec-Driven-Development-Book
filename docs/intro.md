# Introduction

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. This comprehensive guide will take you through the essential concepts and practical implementations needed to build autonomous humanoid robots.

## Overview

This course covers four main modules:

1. **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Core middleware for robotic control
2. **Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - Simulation environments and physics engines
3. **Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)** - Advanced perception, navigation, and synthetic training
4. **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Merging LLMs with embodied robotics

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Build a full ROS 2 control pipeline for a humanoid robot
- Create digital twin environments with accurate physics and sensor simulation
- Implement perception pipelines and navigation using NVIDIA Isaac tools
- Build an autonomous humanoid AI agent that responds to voice commands
